### Node.js and its run time 

### what is ecmascript?
its a scripting language specification or guidlines or rules on which javascript is based 
it says this is what JS should look like ex: there should be number, expression, statements, functions and classes.
so that who ever wites compiler for js should include those specifications
- like every year they add new things that every js compiler should support
as we say js is interpreted language so we can say not compiler but js engine 
- versions ES5. ES6/2015, ES2017

### what is javascript 

its the implementation of ecmascript 
- it includes additional features which are not part of ecmascript 
- ex DOM which is not defined by ECMAScript 
- some more ex like setTimeout, fs.readFile these are introduced by browsers and node.js on top of ecmaScript thats why its called as web API.
- popular engines of js are V8(Google), spidermonkey(firefox) these engines/compilers are not necessarily be written in js but they are written in c, rust
